# CodeShare

A website to share code made using Spring Boot. It is still in development.

Rest end points avaiable as of today:
1. /code/new
1. /code/{id}
1. /code/latest

Rest end points for api:
1. /api/code/new
1. /api/code/{id}
1. /api/code/latest

# Known issue:
1. Post method of end point /code/new is not able to save to the database. However, same with rest api end point can be used to save data.
